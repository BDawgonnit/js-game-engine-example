## Setup
This project requires Node.js to be installed. If it isn't already installed, you can download and run it from the official website at https://nodejs.org/en/.

Once you have the repository cloned, open a terminal, `cd` to the project's root directory and run `npm install` to complete setup.
Then, to start up the server, `npm start`. Finally, open `http://localhost:3030` in a browser and play the game using the keyboard arrows and space
